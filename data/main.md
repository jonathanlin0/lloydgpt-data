## General / Miscellaneous

Quiet hours are after 2 am on Fridays and Saturdays and after midnight otherwise. It's okay to ask your neighbors or people in the hall to be quiet during quiet hours! You can also talk to your LASR and they can take care of it for you.

Ditch day is "tomorrow". Go to bed frosh.

Your (my) favorite color is Gold.

If you need emotional support, you can reach out to the PA's, to our RA and/or RLC. Additionally you can reach the Caltech counseling center at https://wellness.caltech.edu/counseling.

Lloyd roompicks first decides based on class (rising seniors choose rooms first, then juniors, etc). The order within a class is decided in reverse order of Bechtel lottery (high number is better). Lloyd roompicks has guaranteed picks for excomm members as well as screwed-over-seniors who have entered Lloyd roompicks every year without being able to live in Lloyd (other than frosh year). The exact details are in the bylaws.

Rooms are all doubles, and we have 41 rooms. Rooms have couches (which are pretty good!) and beds tend to be lofted (hanging from the ceiling so you have room below), but not all are.

You simply need to connect the USB stick into your laptop. Afterward, select the brother printer from your laptop's print menu to print from the brother printer.

## Memberships

To become a social Lloydie, you will need to attend a house dinner (where you should be invited by a current Lloydie). There, they will announce you and you need to say you are running for a social. Then, you need to fill out the membership application and will be added to the next member elections. A quorum is needed of one-third of the house, so be sure to convince people to vote!

To drop your full Lloyd membership to a social membership, contact the secretary (messenger or email secretary@lloyd.caltech.edu). There is no process needed to downgrade a membership, but be aware that to get a membership back, you need to go through member elections again.

## General Caltech Info

If you are wondering which house is the best, each house has their own merits and is good in their own right.

The 8 houses at Caltech are called Lloyd, Page, Venerable, Blacker, Dabney, Fleming, Ricketts, and Avery.

There are 8 houses at Caltech.

## General Lloyd Info

Lloyd is with the other undergraduate houses on the southeast corner of campus. Lloyd is north of the olive walk and between Page and Venerable.

## Rotation

The Fleming cannon fires once after rotation, once at the end of winter term, and once at the end of spring term.

During rotation, first year students get to meet members of each house, participate in house activities that showcase their unique cultures (dinners, desserts, and big events), and then rank the houses according to their preferences in the End-of-Rotation Form. If students do not wish to affiliate with a house, they are also able to opt out of the House System in the End-of-Rotation Form. After rotation, students may also affiliate with a house by getting to know the members and individually seeking membership through that house's membership process.

Rotation is available only during the first year and cannot be deferred, whereas the individual house membership process is available throughout a student's career. Students who opt for membership in one of the houses may live in the house or may live in the Bechtel residence. If you choose not to be a member of a house, Caltech will ensure that you have housing in one of our unaffiliated housing options, most often Bechtel. For more information about Rotation, please visit ihc.caltech.edu/rotation

## Facility Questions

Fill out a facilities request through access.caltech if your ac/heater is not working.

Fill out a facilities request for pest control through access.caltech if there are ants. If there are multiple rooms experiencing this issue, housing would prefer to come in all at once so submit one. Even if you just want your room sprayed down you can still submit one so they know whose rooms to go to.

Check the availability on the shed scheduling form on the resources page if you want to reserve the shed. The shed has a projector and is great for movies or game nights with friends.

The Braun Athletic Center (also known as the Braun gym or just Braun) is open on weekdays from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm and open on weekends from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm.

## Financial Questions

Use the official reimbursement form on the resources page. This makes it a lot easier for the Treasurer than if you message them.

You can either ask the treasurer (who'll confirm the funding with excomm) if you want to get funding for an event you and your friends want to run, or come to an excomm meeting to pitch your idea for the event!

You can get reimbursed for things you purchased for events if the purchases were approved ahead of time during an excomm meeting. The types of purchases you can propose are things for events that have an existing budget, which can fall under proposed PA events or general house events. Lloyd does not have a 15 for 15 program, like other houses do, but we have a lot more house events and use our budget to the max! Please make sure to ask the treasurer or excomm if a purchase you make can be reimbursed before making the purchase!

Your first full's dues are covered by Caltech. If you have multiple memberships or social memberships, then you need to pay house dues. House dues are due by the first week of each term! If you have a social or a non-primary full with Lloyd, then you have to pay $40 and $60 per term, respectively. You can either pay per term, or pay for the whole year at the beginning!

If you have a social membership with Lloyd, then you must pay \$40 a term. If you have a non-primary full membership with Lloyd (ie you have a Lloyd full but live in another house or have marked another house as your primary house membership), then you must pay \$60 a term. If you don't pay for a term, you cannot attend the major event the term after (camping trip, ski trip, and beach trip). If you do not pay two terms in a row, your membership with Lloyd will be dropped.

If you don't pay for a term, you cannot attend the major event the term after (camping trip, ski trip, and beach trip). If you do not pay two terms in a row, your membership with Lloyd will be dropped.

Sometimes, we reimburse you through the Lloyd PTA, which means we fill out a ticket, and Caltech has to approve it and send you the reimbursement. This can take up to a week or two. But you can send a reminder to the treasurer just in case they forgot to submit the reimbursement!
