Lloyd roompicks first decides based on class (rising seniors choose rooms first, then juniors, etc). The order within a class is decided in reverse order of Bechtel lottery (high number is better). Lloyd roompicks has guaranteed picks for excomm members as well as screwed-over-seniors who have entered Lloyd roompicks every year without being able to live in Lloyd (other than frosh year).

## Housing

These are the possible configurations for housing at Caltech for the North and South Houses: A single holds 1 person. A double holds 2 people. A triple holds 3 people.

The North houses are Venerable House, Lloyd House, and Page House.

The South houses are Ricketts House, Fleming House, Dabney House, and Blacker House.

All rooms in LLoyd House are doubles, and there are 41 rooms. The rooms have couches (which are pretty good!) and beds tend to be lofted (hanging from the ceiling so you have room below), but not all are.

## Memberships

To become a social Lloydie, you will need to attend a house dinner (where you should be invited by a current Lloydie). There, they will announce you and you need to say you are running for a social. Then, you need to fill out the membership application and will be added to the next member elections. A quorum is needed of one-third of the house, so be sure to convince people to vote!

To drop your full Lloyd membership to a social membership, contact the secretary (messenger or email secretary@lloyd.caltech.edu). There is no process needed to downgrade a membership, but be aware that to get a membership back, you need to go through member elections again.

## General Caltech Info

If you are wondering which house is the best, each house has their own merits and is good in their own right.

The 8 houses at Caltech are called Lloyd, Page, Venerable, Blacker, Dabney, Fleming, Ricketts, and Avery.

There are 8 houses at Caltech.

## General Lloyd Info

Lloyd is an undergraduate house at Caltech

Lloyd is with the other undergraduate houses on the southeast corner of campus. Lloyd is north of the olive walk and between Page and Venerable.

## Rotation

The Fleming cannon fires once after rotation, once at the end of winter term, and once at the end of spring term.

During rotation, first year students get to meet members of each house, participate in house activities that showcase their unique cultures (dinners, desserts, and big events), and then rank the houses according to their preferences in the End-of-Rotation Form. If students do not wish to affiliate with a house, they are also able to opt out of the House System in the End-of-Rotation Form. After rotation, students may also affiliate with a house by getting to know the members and individually seeking membership through that house's membership process.

Rotation is available only during the first year and cannot be deferred, whereas the individual house membership process is available throughout a student's career. Students who opt for membership in one of the houses may live in the house or may live in the Bechtel residence. If you choose not to be a member of a house, Caltech will ensure that you have housing in one of our unaffiliated housing options, most often Bechtel. For more information about Rotation, please visit ihc.caltech.edu/rotation

## Facility Questions

Fill out a facilities request through access.caltech if your ac/heater is not working.

Fill out a facilities request for pest control through access.caltech if there are ants. If there are multiple rooms experiencing this issue, housing would prefer to come in all at once so submit one. Even if you just want your room sprayed down you can still submit one so they know whose rooms to go to.

Check the availability on the shed scheduling form on the resources page if you want to reserve the shed. The shed has a projector and is great for movies or game nights with friends.

The Braun Athletic Center (also known as the Braun gym or just Braun) is open on weekdays from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm and open on weekends from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm.

## Financial Questions

Use the official reimbursement form on the resources page. This makes it a lot easier for the Treasurer than if you message them.

You can either ask the treasurer (who'll confirm the funding with excomm) if you want to get funding for an event you and your friends want to run, or come to an excomm meeting to pitch your idea for the event!

You can get reimbursed for things you purchased for events if the purchases were approved ahead of time during an excomm meeting. The types of purchases you can propose are things for events that have an existing budget, which can fall under proposed PA events or general house events. Lloyd does not have a 15 for 15 program, like other houses do, but we have a lot more house events and use our budget to the max! Please make sure to ask the treasurer or excomm if a purchase you make can be reimbursed before making the purchase!

Your first full's dues are covered by Caltech. If you have multiple memberships or social memberships, then you need to pay house dues. House dues are due by the first week of each term! If you have a social or a non-primary full with Lloyd, then you have to pay $40 and $60 per term, respectively. You can either pay per term, or pay for the whole year at the beginning!

If you have a social membership with Lloyd, then you must pay \$40 a term. If you have a non-primary full membership with Lloyd (ie you have a Lloyd full but live in another house or have marked another house as your primary house membership), then you must pay \$60 a term. If you don't pay for a term, you cannot attend the major event the term after (camping trip, ski trip, and beach trip). If you do not pay two terms in a row, your membership with Lloyd will be dropped.

If you don't pay for a term, you cannot attend the major event the term after (camping trip, ski trip, and beach trip). If you do not pay two terms in a row, your membership with Lloyd will be dropped.

Sometimes, we reimburse you through the Lloyd PTA, which means we fill out a ticket, and Caltech has to approve it and send you the reimbursement. This can take up to a week or two. But you can send a reminder to the treasurer just in case they forgot to submit the reimbursement!

## Rotation Algorithm

The algorithm we are running is a convex penalty algorithm which works in the following manner:

Each first-year student submits an ordered ranking of residences (8 houses and Bechtel). They can only have one first choice, though they may tie subsequent residences. However, their ranking must always be ordinal. For example, a student may rank Booty House first and tie all of the other houses for second. They may not rank Booty House first and tie all of the other houses for ninth. First-year students may elect to receive a house membership for the event if their assigned first year residence is Bechtel.

The Rotation Concerns Committee (RCC, comprised of a dean, the ORE director, the director of Residential Experience, the ADA coordinator, the CCID director, and the IHC Chair) will go through all concerns (including ADA needs) and place students in rooms. The RCC will do the best it can to respect house wishes. The algorithm is run for the remaining students in two stages:

Students will be sorted using a convex penalty algorithm. The algorithm overall works to minimize the total penalty. The penalty is calculated by squaring the prefrosh ranking of the house they end up in. There are also some additional conditions the algorithm takes into consideration in producing a final solution

The algorithm also accounts for gender inclusivity, gender balance, and maximizing the % each house fills.

The IHC and VPSA will choose between the remaining choices in a closed meeting.

## Lloyd Rotation Data

There are seven alleys in Lloyd: Tropic, Inferno, Valhalla, Purple, Kaos, VI, and Fingals. There is
another alley next to Valhalla named Dead alley, which is home to the Llibrary and the Shed.
Some common things that Lloydies do for fun are:

Lloyd is a very diverse house with people who have every interest. Lloydies commonly will
gather to watch all types of movies and shows in the shed, our own little movie room. Lloydies
play lots of pool, ping pong, chess/bughouse and Nintendo switch games such as Super Smash
Bros and more. We have people playing these games at all levels, from beginners to people
competing in national competitions. One Lloydie even developed an elo ranking system for the
more competitive ping pong players in the house, and ‘Elo Nights’ and ping pong tournaments
are common. Many Lloydies are on the Caltech varsity sports teams, and even more enjoy
playing in recreational leagues and interhouse sports. In fact, the Sunday league soccer team
Beaver Ballers FC was founded by a group of Lloydies. Lloydies love to hang out in common
areas such as lower crotch, commonly called LC.

Lloyd house dinners rules are as follows:
Lloyd dinners are waited. If you would like more of a food item or drink simply raise your
glass/plate and a waiter will come by. For drinks, waiters can make any drink you could possibly
ask for. For example, a ‘rainbow road’ is a common drink request. Students can throw dry bread
if they are given permission to do so from a waiter. Students can not throw any other food or
drink, and if they do they may be kicked out of dinner. Students may not hit any waiters with
bread that they are throwing. If any Lloydies are caught breaking the dinner rules, they will be
on the list to be floated. Rotating students can not be floated, so if they break the rules, the
Lloydie sitting to their left will be placed on the list to be floated. Being floated is a completely
opt-in decision, and any student can choose to not be floated on any given day, regardless of
the list.

Lloyd house was founded in 1960 and is named after Ralph B. Lloyd and Lulu Hull Lloyd. The
house color is gold, and its motto is “I llive and die for those I llove”. Lloydies commonly put
double ls on the names of things. For example, the Lloyd library is called the Llibrary, the lounge
is called the llounge etc.

Lloyd house has 41 rooms, all of which are doubles. The majority of rooms have beds which are
lofted, in which the beds are lifted into the air in order to create more rooms for desks and
couches. Lloyd house is the only house which can boast that every room comes with a couch.
There are 6 bathrooms in Lloyd house, a men’s, women’s and gender neutral bathroom is on
each floor. Lloyd house is two stories, and is conveniently shaped like an L so you can never get
lost.

The laundry room is in the basement of Lloyd house, in the passageways which connect all of
the north houses. This laundry room is shared with the other north houses, Page and
Venerable.

The shed is a movie room on the first floor of Lloyd in dead alley. Lloydies commonly use this
room to host watch parties of movies, tv shows, sports games, and more!

When it is a lloydie’s birthday, the LASR of the lloydie will run around the house screaming
“BIRTHDAY IN LC”. Then, lloydies will congregate in LC, where the birthday person is sitting,
and they will wish the birthday person a
“HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApy Birthday” and everybody will eat a cake.
Every Thursday at house dinner, Rant Night happens. In this, lloydies are given the free reign to
rant to their fellow lloydies about their day/week/year/life to get all of that stress out.
Lloydcoin is the premier cryptocurrency on the market, soon to overtake bitcoin as the future of
all of crypto🤑

Lloyd is a north house, along with Page and Venerable.
For support in all of the houses, there are Peer Advocates (PAs), student leaders who are
trained in listening skills and addressing mental health issues, Health Advocates (Health Ads),
student leaders who are trained in mental and physical health, including emergency first aid,
Title IX Advocates (Title IX Ads), student leaders who are trained in addressing and helping
students through title IX situations.

In Lloyd specifically, there are also Lloyd Alley Support Representatives (LASRs). A LASR is a designated upperclassman that any member of the alley can go to for support, guidance, information, or a general friendly face in a new environment. Additionally, many social activities in Lloyd are run on an alley by alley basis, and are thus run
by the LASRs as well.
